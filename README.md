# MCW-D50-Comms
Protocol for over-ethernet communications with Beyerdynamic MCW-D50 conference unit.

In this repository I want to find (or reverse-engineer) a protocol for communications with beyerdynamic mcw-d50 digital conference unit with a hope for creating open source software to control it.

Since I do not own the unit, I cannot always experiment with it. So, I'll try to work on this project when I have access to the unit.

All the data I've gathered will be [here](Info.md).
